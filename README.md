# Cloud Resume Challenge

To further build on my devops skills, I'm looking to complete a slightly tweaked Cloud Resume Challenge.

## Goals

- An end to end automated build pipeline launched from merged PRs
- Static web page hosted in AWS

## To Do

- [ ] Finish README
- [ ] Define end state
- [ ] Define tools / languages required
- [ ] Define MVP
